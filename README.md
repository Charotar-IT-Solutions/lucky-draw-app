## Project Vision

The LuckyDrawPlatform is aimed at creating an engaging and interactive platform where users can try their luck by participating in various lucky draws. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **User Registration**: Users can sign up using their email address, creating a unique account for easy access.

2. **Lucky Draw Participation**: Users can join various lucky draws listed on the platform. To participate, they need to purchase tickets. Each user is entitled to one free entry per day.

3. **User-Friendly UI/UX**: We plan to use Bootstrap for the front-end to provide an attractive and user-friendly interface, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for our users.

4. **Robust Backend**: The platform's backend will be powered by PHP, MySQL, Node.js, and Python. This combination of technologies will ensure the system's reliability, scalability, and security.

5. **Desktop and Mobile Apps**: We intend to extend our services by building desktop and mobile applications using Python with Kivy, offering a versatile experience for users on various devices.

6. **Automated Lucky Draw Creation**: The platform will automatically create lucky draws with customizable properties such as the draw name, the number of entries allowed, the time of the draw, the winning prize, and more.

7. **Countdown Timer**: To build excitement, we will display countdown timers for each active draw, keeping users informed about when the results will be announced.

8. **Winner Showcase**: We will provide a dedicated page to display the winners of previous lucky draws, adding transparency and credibility to the platform.
